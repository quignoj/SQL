For this project, I worked with a data set that represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 
Check out the different queries I ran below:

SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM customers;

SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

/*Find invoices from Customers from Brazil*/

SELECT FirstName, LastName,Invoiceid, InvoiceDate, Country FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices ON customers.CustomerID = invoices.Customerid;

/*Show the Employees who are Sales Agents*/
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

/*Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table*/
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry FROM invoices;

/*Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name*/
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName,employees.Title,BillingCountry, InvoiceId FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices ON customers.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
INNER JOIN employees ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

/*Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers*/
SELECT employees.FirstName AS SalesAgentFirstName,employees.LastName AS SalesAgentLastName,customers.FirstName AS CustomerFirstName, customers.LastName AS CustomerLastName, InvoiceId,invoices.Total FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices ON customers.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
INNER JOIN employees ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId;

/*How many Invoices were there in 2009?*/
SELECT * FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

/*What are the total sales for 2009?*/
SELECT SUM(Total) FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.*/
SELECT tracks.Name, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId FROM invoice_items
INNER JOIN tracks ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;

/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.*/
SELECT tracks.Name AS 'Track', artists.Name AS 'Artist', invoice_items.InvoiceId FROM invoice_items
LEFT JOIN tracks
ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId
JOIN albums
ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN artists
ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId;

/*Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre*/
SELECT tracks.TrackId, albums.Title AS 'Album Name', genres.Name AS 'Genre', tracks.MediaTypeId AS 'Media Type' FROM tracks
LEFT JOIN genres
ON tracks.GenreId= genres.GenreId
JOIN albums
ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
ORDER BY tracks.TrackId ASC;

/*Show the total sales made by each sales agent.*/
SELECT SUM (invoices.Total) AS 'Total Sales', employees.FirstName, employees.LastName FROM customers
LEFT JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
JOIN employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
GROUP BY employees.EmployeeId;

/*Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?*/
SELECT SUM (invoices.Total)AS 'Total Sales', employees.FirstName, employees.LastName FROM customers
LEFT JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
JOIN employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY employees.EmployeeId;
